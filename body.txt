Edit this page  Share Theme Sign in Naming and Namespaces minutes to read All file systems supported by Windows use the concept of files and directories to access data stored on disk or Windows developers working with the Windows APIs for file and device I/O should understand the various and limitations of names for files and Data can be accessed from and network shares using file I/O Files and along with are part of the concept of which is string representation of where to get the data regardless if it's from disk or device or network connection for specific Some file such as support linked files and which also follow file naming conventions and rules just as regular file or directory For additional see Hard Links and Junctions and Reparse Points and File Operations For additional see the following File and Directory Names Naming Conventions Short Long Names Paths Fully Qualified Relative Paths Maximum Path Length Limitation Namespaces Win32 File Namespaces Win32 Device Namespaces NT Namespaces Related topics File and Directory Names All file systems follow the same general naming conventions for an individual base file name and an optional separated by each file such as and can have specific and differing rules about the formation of the individual components in the path to directory or Note that directory is simply file with special attribute designating it as but otherwise must follow all the same naming rules as regular Because the term directory simply refers to special type of file as far as the file system is some reference material will use the general term file to encompass both concepts of directories and data files as Because of unless otherwise any naming or usage rules or examples for file should also apply to The term path refers to one or more and possibly volume For more see the Paths Character count limitations can also be different and can vary depending on the file system and path name prefix format This is further complicated by support for backward compatibility For the older MS-DOS FAT file system supports maximum of characters for the base file name and characters for the for total of characters including the dot This is commonly known as an file name The Windows FAT and NTFS file systems are not limited to file because they have long file name support but they still support the version of long file Naming Conventions The following fundamental rules enable applications to create and process valid names for files and regardless of the file Use period to separate the base file name from the extension in the name of directory or Use backslash to separate the components of path The backslash divides the file name from the path to and one directory name from another directory name in You cannot use backslash in the name for the actual file or directory because it is reserved character that separates the names into Use backslash as required as part of volume names for the in or the in for Universal Naming Convention For more information about UNC see the Maximum Path Length Limitation Do not assume case For consider the names and oscar to be the even though some file systems as POSIX-compliant file may consider them as Note that NTFS supports POSIX semantics for case sensitivity but this is not the default For more see CreateFile Volume designators are similarly For and refer to the same Use any character in the current code page for including Unicode characters and characters in the extended character set except for the The following reserved bar or Integer value sometimes referred to as the ASCII NUL Characters whose integer representations are in the range from through except for alternate data streams where these characters are For more information about file see File Streams Any other character that the target file system does not Use period as directory component in path to represent the current for example For more see Paths Use two consecutive periods as directory component in path to represent the parent of the current for example For more see Paths Do not use the following reserved names for the name of and Also avoid these names followed immediately by an for NUL.txt is not For more see Namespaces Do not end file or directory name with space or Although the underlying file system may support such the Windows shell and user interface does it is acceptable to specify period as the first character of For Short Long Names long file name is considered to be any file name that exceeds the short MS-DOS called style naming When you create long file Windows may also create short form of the called the alias or short and store it on disk This aliasing can be disabled for performance reasons either systemwide or for specified depending on the particular file Windows Server Windows Windows Server and Windows aliasing cannot be disabled for specified volumes until Windows and Windows Server On many file file name will contain tilde within each component of the name that is too long to comply with naming Note Not all file systems follow the tilde substitution and systems can be configured to disable alias generation even if they normally support do not make the assumption that the alias already exists To request file long file or the full path of file from the consider the following To get the form of long file use the GetShortPathName To get the long file name version of short use the GetLongPathName To get the full path to use the GetFullPathName On newer file such as and Windows stores the long file names on disk in which means that the original long file name is always This is true even if long file name contains extended regardless of the code page that is active during disk read or write Files using long file names can be copied between NTFS file system partitions and Windows FAT file system partitions without losing any file name This may not be true for the older MS-DOS FAT and some types of CDFS file depending on the actual file In this the short file name is substituted if Paths The path to specified file consists of one or more components separated by special character with each component usually being directory name or file but with some notable exceptions discussed It is often critical to the system's interpretation of path what the or prefix of the path looks This prefix determines the namespace the path is and additionally what special characters are used in which position within the including the last If component of path is file it must be the last Each component of path will also be constrained by the maximum length specified for particular file In these rules fall into two short and long Note that directory names are stored by the file system as special type of but naming rules for files also apply to directory To path is simply the string representation of the hierarchy between all of the directories that exist for particular file or directory Fully Qualified Relative Paths For Windows API functions that manipulate file names can often be relative to the current while some APIs require fully qualified file name is relative to the current directory if it does not begin with one of the UNC name of any which always start with two backslash characters For more see the next disk designator with for example or single for or This is also referred to as an absolute path If file name begins with only disk designator but not the backslash after the it is interpreted as relative path to the current directory on the drive with the specified Note that the current directory may or may not be the root directory depending on what it was set to during the most recent operation on that Examples of this format are as refers to file named in the current directory on drive refers to file in subdirectory to the current directory on drive path is also said to be relative if it contains that two periods together in one component of the This special specifier is used to denote the directory above the current otherwise known as the Examples of this format are as specifies file named tmp.txt located in the parent of the current specifies file that is two directories above the current specifies file named tmp.txt located in directory named tempdir that is peer directory to the current Relative paths can combine both example for example This is useful although the system keeps track of the current drive along with the current directory of that it also keeps track of the current directories in each of the different drive letters your system has more than regardless of which drive designator is set as the current Maximum Path Length Limitation In the Windows API some exceptions discussed in the following the maximum length for path is MAX_PATH which is defined as local path is structured in the following drive name components separated by and terminating null For the maximum path on drive is some path string where represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system characters are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of valid path Note File I/O functions in the Windows API convert to as part of converting the name to an NT-style except when using the prefix as detailed in the following The Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit an extended-length path for maximum total path length of This type of path is composed of components separated by each up to the value returned in the lpMaximumComponentLength parameter of the GetVolumeInformation function value is commonly To specify an extended-length use the For very long path Note The maximum path of characters is because the prefix may be expanded to longer string by the system at run and this expansion applies to the total The prefix can also be used with paths constructed according to the universal naming convention To specify such path using use the For where is the name of the computer and is the name of the shared These prefixes are not used as part of the path They indicate that the path should be passed to the system with minimal which means that you cannot use forward slashes to represent path or period to represent the current or double dots to represent the parent Because you cannot use the prefix with relative relative paths are always limited to total of MAX_PATH There is no need to perform any Unicode normalization on path and file name strings for use by the Windows file I/O API functions because the file system treats path and file names as an opaque sequence of WCHAR Any normalization that your application requires should be performed with this in external of any calls to related Windows file I/O API When using an API to create the specified path cannot be so long that you cannot append an file name the directory name cannot exceed MAX_PATH minus The shell and the file system have different It is possible to create path with the Windows API that the shell user interface is not able to interpret Tip Starting in Windows version MAX_PATH limitations have been removed from common Win32 file and directory you must opt-in to the new registry key allows you to enable or disable the new long path To enable long path behavior set the registry key at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem LongPathsEnabled The key's value will be cached by the system after the first call to an affected Win32 file or directory function The registry key will not be reloaded during the lifetime of the In order for all apps on the system to recognize the value of the reboot might be required because some processes may have started before the key was The registry key can also be controlled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration Administrative Templates System Filesystem Enable NTFS long paths You can also enable the new long path behavior per app via the true These are the directory management functions that no longer have MAX_PATH restrictions if you opt-in to long path CreateDirectoryExW GetCurrentDirectoryW RemoveDirectoryW These are the file management functions that no longer have MAX_PATH restrictions if you opt-in to long path Namespaces There are two main categories of namespace conventions used in the Windows commonly referred to as NT namespaces and the Win32 namespaces The NT namespace was designed to be the lowest level namespace on which other subsystems and namespaces could including the Win32 subsystem by the Win32 POSIX is another example of subsystem in Windows that is built on top of the NT Early versions of Windows also defined several or names for certain special devices such as communications and ports and the default display console as part of what is now called the NT device and are still supported in current versions of Windows for backward Win32 File Namespaces The Win32 namespace prefixing and conventions are summarized in this section and the following with descriptions of how they are Note that these examples are intended for use with the Windows API functions and do not all necessarily work with Windows shell applications such as Windows For this reason there is wider range of possible paths than is usually available from Windows shell and Windows applications that take advantage of this can be developed using these namespace For file the prefix to path string tells the Windows APIs to disable all string parsing and to send the string that follows it straight to the file For if the file system supports large paths and file you can exceed the MAX_PATH limits that are otherwise enforced by the Windows For more information about the normal maximum path see the previous section Maximum Path Length Limitation Because it turns off automatic expansion of the path the prefix also allows the use of and in the path which can be useful if you are attempting to perform operations on file with these otherwise reserved relative path specifiers as part of the fully qualified Many but not all file I/O APIs support you should look at the reference topic for each API to be Win32 Device Namespaces The prefix will access the Win32 device namespace instead of the Win32 file This is how access to physical disks and volumes is accomplished without going through the file if the API supports this type of You can access many devices other than disks this way the CreateFile and DefineDosDevice for For if you want to open the system's serial communications port you can use in the call to the CreateFile This works because COM1?COM9 are part of the reserved names in the NT although using the prefix will also work with these device By if you have port serial expansion board installed and want to open you cannot open it using because there is no predefined NT namespace for You will need to open it using because goes directly to the device namespace without attempting to locate predefined Another example of using the Win32 device namespace is using the CreateFile function with is valid integer or This allows you to access those devices bypassing the file This works because these device names are created by the system as these devices are and some drivers will also create other aliases in the For the device driver that implements the name has its own namespace that also happens to be the file APIs that go through the CreateFile function generally work with the prefix because CreateFile is the function used to open both files and depending on the parameters you If you're working with Windows API you should use the prefix to access devices only and not Most APIs won't support only those that are designed to work with the device namespace will recognize Always check the reference topic for each API to be NT Namespaces There are also APIs that allow the use of the NT namespace but the Windows Object Manager makes that unnecessary in most To it is useful to browse the Windows namespaces in the system object browser using the Windows Sysinternals WinObj When you run this what you see is the NT namespace beginning at the or The subfolder called is where the Win32 namespace Named device objects reside in the NT namespace within the Here you may also find Serial0 and the device objects representing the first two COM ports if present on your device object representing volume would be something like although the numeric suffix may The name under subdirectory is an example of the device object representing and so To make these device objects accessible by Windows the device drivers create symbolic link in the Win32 to their respective device For COM0 and COM1 under the subdirectory are simply symlinks to Serial0 and is symlink to is symlink to and so Without specified device will not be available to any Windows application using Win32 namespace conventions as described handle could be opened to that device using any APIs that support the NT namespace absolute path of the format With the addition of multi-user support via Terminal Services and virtual it has further become necessary to virtualize the system-wide root device within the Win32 This was accomplished by adding the symlink named to the Win32 which you can see in the subdirectory of the WinObj browser tool previously and can access via the path This prefix ensures that the path following it looks in the true root

sometimes called syntactic because they operate on the path itself and don't access the file This section covers the Creating Path Retrieving Information About Path Removing Redundancies from Path Converting Path Joining Two Paths Creating Path Between Two Paths Comparing Two Paths Creating Path Path instance contains the information used to specify the location of file or At the time it is Path is provided with series of one or more root element or file name might be but neither are Path might consist of just single directory or file You can easily create Path object by using one of the following get methods from the Paths the helper Path p1 Path p2 Path p3 The Paths.get method is shorthand for the following Path p4 The following example creates assuming your home directory is or C:\joe\logs\foo.log if you are on Path p5 Retrieving Information about Path You can think of the Path as storing these name elements as The highest element in the directory structure would be located at index The lowest element in the directory structure would be located at index where is the number of name elements in the Path Methods are available for retrieving individual elements or subsequence of the Path using these The examples in this lesson use the following directory Sample Directory Structure The following code snippet defines Path instance and then invokes several methods

the next Converting Path Converting Path You can use three methods to convert the Path If you need to convert the path to string that can be opened from you can use toUri For Path p1 Result is file:///home/logfile The toAbsolutePath method converts path to an absolute If the passed-in path is already it returns the same Path The toAbsolutePath method can be very helpful when processing user-entered file For public class FileTest public static void if FileTest Converts the input string to Path Path inputPath Converts the input Path to an absolute this means prepending the current working If this example were called like java FileTest foo the getRoot and getParent methods would return null on the original Invoking getRoot and getParent on the instance returns expected Path fullPath The toAbsolutePath method converts the user input and returns Path that returns useful values when The file does not need to exist for this method to The toRealPath method returns the real path of an existing This method performs several operations in If true is passed to this method and the file system supports symbolic this method resolves any symbolic links in the If the Path is it returns an absolute If the Path contains any redundant it returns path with those elements This method throws an exception if the file does not exist or cannot be You can catch the exception when you want to handle any of these For try Path fp catch no file or Logic for case when file doesn't catch Logic for other sort of file Joining Two Paths You can combine paths by using the resolve You pass in partial path which is path that does not include root and that partial path is appended to the original For consider the following code Solaris Path p1 Result is or Microsoft Windows Path p1 Result is C:\home\joe\foo\bar Passing an absolute path to the resolve method returns the passed-in Result is Creating Path Between Two Paths common requirement when you are writing file I/O code is the capability to construct path from one location in the file system to another You can meet this using the relativize This method constructs path originating from the original path and ending at the location specified by the passed-in The new path is relative to the original For consider two relative paths defined as joe and sally Path p1 Path p2 In the absence of any other it is assumed that joe and sally are meaning nodes that reside at the same level in the tree To navigate from joe to sally you would expect to first navigate one level up to the parent node and then down to sally Result is Path p1_to_p2 Result is Path p2_to_p1 Consider slightly more complicated Path p1 Path p3 Result is sally/bar Path p1_to_p3 Result is Path p3_to_p1 In this the two paths share the same home To navigate from home to bar you first navigate one level down to sally and then one more level down to bar Navigating from bar to home requires moving up two relative path cannot be constructed if only one of the paths includes root If both paths include root the capability to construct relative path is system The recursive Copy example uses the relativize and resolve Comparing Two Paths The Path class supports equals enabling you to test two paths for The startsWith and endsWith methods enable you to test whether path begins or ends with particular These methods are easy to For Path path Path otherPath Path beginning Path ending if equality logic here else if path begins with else if path ends with The Path class implements the Iterable The iterator method returns an object that enables you to iterate over the name elements in the The first element returned is that closest to the root in the directory The following code snippet iterates over printing each name Path path for The Path class also implements the Comparable You can compare Path objects by using compareTo which is useful for You can also put Path objects into Collection See the Collections trail for more information about this powerful When you want to verify that two Path objects locate the same you can use the isSameFile as described in Checking Whether Two Paths Locate the Same File Previous Trail Next About

Edit this page  Share Theme Sign in Naming and Namespaces minutes to read All file systems supported by Windows use the concept of files and directories to access data stored on disk or Windows developers working with the Windows APIs for file and device I/O should understand the various and limitations of names for files and Data can be accessed from and network shares using file I/O Files and along with are part of the concept of which is string representation of where to get the data regardless if it's from disk or device or network connection for specific Some file such as support linked files and which also follow file naming conventions and rules just as regular file or directory For additional see Hard Links and Junctions and Reparse Points and File Operations For additional see the following File and Directory Names Naming Conventions Short Long Names Paths Fully Qualified Relative Paths Maximum Path Length Limitation Namespaces Win32 File Namespaces Win32 Device Namespaces NT Namespaces Related topics File and Directory Names All file systems follow the same general naming conventions for an individual base file name and an optional separated by each file such as and can have specific and differing rules about the formation of the individual components in the path to directory or Note that directory is simply file with special attribute designating it as but otherwise must follow all the same naming rules as regular Because the term directory simply refers to special type of file as far as the file system is some reference material will use the general term file to encompass both concepts of directories and data files as Because of unless otherwise any naming or usage rules or examples for file should also apply to The term path refers to one or more and possibly volume For more see the Paths Character count limitations can also be different and can vary depending on the file system and path name prefix format This is further complicated by support for backward compatibility For the older MS-DOS FAT file system supports maximum of characters for the base file name and characters for the for total of characters including the dot This is commonly known as an file name The Windows FAT and NTFS file systems are not limited to file because they have long file name support but they still support the version of long file Naming Conventions The following fundamental rules enable applications to create and process valid names for files and regardless of the file Use period to separate the base file name from the extension in the name of directory or Use backslash to separate the components of path The backslash divides the file name from the path to and one directory name from another directory name in You cannot use backslash in the name for the actual file or directory because it is reserved character that separates the names into Use backslash as required as part of volume names for the in or the in for Universal Naming Convention For more information about UNC see the Maximum Path Length Limitation Do not assume case For consider the names and oscar to be the even though some file systems as POSIX-compliant file may consider them as Note that NTFS supports POSIX semantics for case sensitivity but this is not the default For more see CreateFile Volume designators are similarly For and refer to the same Use any character in the current code page for including Unicode characters and characters in the extended character set except for the The following reserved bar or Integer value sometimes referred to as the ASCII NUL Characters whose integer representations are in the range from through except for alternate data streams where these characters are For more information about file see File Streams Any other character that the target file system does not Use period as directory component in path to represent the current for example For more see Paths Use two consecutive periods as directory component in path to represent the parent of the current for example For more see Paths Do not use the following reserved names for the name of and Also avoid these names followed immediately by an for NUL.txt is not For more see Namespaces Do not end file or directory name with space or Although the underlying file system may support such the Windows shell and user interface does it is acceptable to specify period as the first character of For Short Long Names long file name is considered to be any file name that exceeds the short MS-DOS called style naming When you create long file Windows may also create short form of the called the alias or short and store it on disk This aliasing can be disabled for performance reasons either systemwide or for specified depending on the particular file Windows Server Windows Windows Server and Windows aliasing cannot be disabled for specified volumes until Windows and Windows Server On many file file name will contain tilde within each component of the name that is too long to comply with naming Note Not all file systems follow the tilde substitution and systems can be configured to disable alias generation even if they normally support do not make the assumption that the alias already exists To request file long file or the full path of file from the consider the following To get the form of long file use the GetShortPathName To get the long file name version of short use the GetLongPathName To get the full path to use the GetFullPathName On newer file such as and Windows stores the long file names on disk in which means that the original long file name is always This is true even if long file name contains extended regardless of the code page that is active during disk read or write Files using long file names can be copied between NTFS file system partitions and Windows FAT file system partitions without losing any file name This may not be true for the older MS-DOS FAT and some types of CDFS file depending on the actual file In this the short file name is substituted if Paths The path to specified file consists of one or more components separated by special character with each component usually being directory name or file but with some notable exceptions discussed It is often critical to the system's interpretation of path what the or prefix of the path looks This prefix determines the namespace the path is and additionally what special characters are used in which position within the including the last If component of path is file it must be the last Each component of path will also be constrained by the maximum length specified for particular file In these rules fall into two short and long Note that directory names are stored by the file system as special type of but naming rules for files also apply to directory To path is simply the string representation of the hierarchy between all of the directories that exist for particular file or directory Fully Qualified Relative Paths For Windows API functions that manipulate file names can often be relative to the current while some APIs require fully qualified file name is relative to the current directory if it does not begin with one of the UNC name of any which always start with two backslash characters For more see the next disk designator with for example or single for or This is also referred to as an absolute path If file name begins with only disk designator but not the backslash after the it is interpreted as relative path to the current directory on the drive with the specified Note that the current directory may or may not be the root directory depending on what it was set to during the most recent operation on that Examples of this format are as refers to file named in the current directory on drive refers to file in subdirectory to the current directory on drive path is also said to be relative if it contains that two periods together in one component of the This special specifier is used to denote the directory above the current otherwise known as the Examples of this format are as specifies file named tmp.txt located in the parent of the current specifies file that is two directories above the current specifies file named tmp.txt located in directory named tempdir that is peer directory to the current Relative paths can combine both example for example This is useful although the system keeps track of the current drive along with the current directory of that it also keeps track of the current directories in each of the different drive letters your system has more than regardless of which drive designator is set as the current Maximum Path Length Limitation In the Windows API some exceptions discussed in the following the maximum length for path is MAX_PATH which is defined as local path is structured in the following drive name components separated by and terminating null For the maximum path on drive is some path string where represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system characters are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of valid path Note File I/O functions in the Windows API convert to as part of converting the name to an NT-style except when using the prefix as detailed in the following The Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit an extended-length path for maximum total path length of This type of path is composed of components separated by each up to the value returned in the lpMaximumComponentLength parameter of the GetVolumeInformation function value is commonly To specify an extended-length use the For very long path Note The maximum path of characters is because the prefix may be expanded to longer string by the system at run and this expansion applies to the total The prefix can also be used with paths constructed according to the universal naming convention To specify such path using use the For where is the name of the computer and is the name of the shared These prefixes are not used as part of the path They indicate that the path should be passed to the system with minimal which means that you cannot use forward slashes to represent path or period to represent the current or double dots to represent the parent Because you cannot use the prefix with relative relative paths are always limited to total of MAX_PATH There is no need to perform any Unicode normalization on path and file name strings for use by the Windows file I/O API functions because the file system treats path and file names as an opaque sequence of WCHAR Any normalization that your application requires should be performed with this in external of any calls to related Windows file I/O API When using an API to create the specified path cannot be so long that you cannot append an file name the directory name cannot exceed MAX_PATH minus The shell and the file system have different It is possible to create path with the Windows API that the shell user interface is not able to interpret Tip Starting in Windows version MAX_PATH limitations have been removed from common Win32 file and directory you must opt-in to the new registry key allows you to enable or disable the new long path To enable long path behavior set the registry key at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem LongPathsEnabled The key's value will be cached by the system after the first call to an affected Win32 file or directory function The registry key will not be reloaded during the lifetime of the In order for all apps on the system to recognize the value of the reboot might be required because some processes may have started before the key was The registry key can also be controlled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration Administrative Templates System Filesystem Enable NTFS long paths You can also enable the new long path behavior per app via the true These are the directory management functions that no longer have MAX_PATH restrictions if you opt-in to long path CreateDirectoryExW GetCurrentDirectoryW RemoveDirectoryW These are the file management functions that no longer have MAX_PATH restrictions if you opt-in to long path Namespaces There are two main categories of namespace conventions used in the Windows commonly referred to as NT namespaces and the Win32 namespaces The NT namespace was designed to be the lowest level namespace on which other subsystems and namespaces could including the Win32 subsystem by the Win32 POSIX is another example of subsystem in Windows that is built on top of the NT Early versions of Windows also defined several or names for certain special devices such as communications and ports and the default display console as part of what is now called the NT device and are still supported in current versions of Windows for backward Win32 File Namespaces The Win32 namespace prefixing and conventions are summarized in this section and the following with descriptions of how they are Note that these examples are intended for use with the Windows API functions and do not all necessarily work with Windows shell applications such as Windows For this reason there is wider range of possible paths than is usually available from Windows shell and Windows applications that take advantage of this can be developed using these namespace For file the prefix to path string tells the Windows APIs to disable all string parsing and to send the string that follows it straight to the file For if the file system supports large paths and file you can exceed the MAX_PATH limits that are otherwise enforced by the Windows For more information about the normal maximum path see the previous section Maximum Path Length Limitation Because it turns off automatic expansion of the path the prefix also allows the use of and in the path which can be useful if you are attempting to perform operations on file with these otherwise reserved relative path specifiers as part of the fully qualified Many but not all file I/O APIs support you should look at the reference topic for each API to be Win32 Device Namespaces The prefix will access the Win32 device namespace instead of the Win32 file This is how access to physical disks and volumes is accomplished without going through the file if the API supports this type of You can access many devices other than disks this way the CreateFile and DefineDosDevice for For if you want to open the system's serial communications port you can use in the call to the CreateFile This works because COM1?COM9 are part of the reserved names in the NT although using the prefix will also work with these device By if you have port serial expansion board installed and want to open you cannot open it using because there is no predefined NT namespace for You will need to open it using because goes directly to the device namespace without attempting to locate predefined Another example of using the Win32 device namespace is using the CreateFile function with is valid integer or This allows you to access those devices bypassing the file This works because these device names are created by the system as these devices are and some drivers will also create other aliases in the For the device driver that implements the name has its own namespace that also happens to be the file APIs that go through the CreateFile function generally work with the prefix because CreateFile is the function used to open both files and depending on the parameters you If you're working with Windows API you should use the prefix to access devices only and not Most APIs won't support only those that are designed to work with the device namespace will recognize Always check the reference topic for each API to be NT Namespaces There are also APIs that allow the use of the NT namespace but the Windows Object Manager makes that unnecessary in most To it is useful to browse the Windows namespaces in the system object browser using the Windows Sysinternals WinObj When you run this what you see is the NT namespace beginning at the or The subfolder called is where the Win32 namespace Named device objects reside in the NT namespace within the Here you may also find Serial0 and the device objects representing the first two COM ports if present on your device object representing volume would be something like although the numeric suffix may The name under subdirectory is an example of the device object representing and so To make these device objects accessible by Windows the device drivers create symbolic link in the Win32 to their respective device For COM0 and COM1 under the subdirectory are simply symlinks to Serial0 and is symlink to is symlink to and so Without specified device will not be available to any Windows application using Win32 namespace conventions as described handle could be opened to that device using any APIs that support the NT namespace absolute path of the format With the addition of multi-user support via Terminal Services and virtual it has further become necessary to virtualize the system-wide root device within the Win32 This was accomplished by adding the symlink named to the Win32 which you can see in the subdirectory of the WinObj browser tool previously and can access via the path This prefix ensures that the path following it looks in the true root

Language Specification Class Literals hashCode public int Returns hash code value for the This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap The general contract of hashCode Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of Java the hashCode method must consistently return the same provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same If two objects are equal according to the then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash As much as is reasonably the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an but this implementation technique is not required by the programming hash code value for this See equals public boolean Object Indicates whether some other object is this The equals method implements an equivalence relation on non-null

that comprise the internal of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the If class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by super.clone need to be The method clone for class Object performs specific cloning if the class of this object does not implement the

finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be The finalize method may take any including making this object available again to other the usual purpose of finalize is to perform cleanup actions before the object is irrevocably For the finalize method for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is permanently The finalize method of class Object performs no special it simply returns Subclasses of Object may override this The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread

practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later Path Operations The Path class includes various methods that can be used to obtain information about the access elements of the convert the path to other or extract portions of There are also methods for matching the path string and methods for removing redundancies in This lesson addresses these Path sometimes called syntactic because they operate on the path itself and don't access the file This section covers the Creating Path Retrieving Information About Path Removing Redundancies from Path Converting Path Joining Two Paths Creating Path Between Two Paths Comparing Two Paths Creating Path Path instance contains the information used to specify the location of file or At the time it is Path is provided with series of one or more root element or file name might be but neither are Path might consist of just single directory or file You can easily create Path object by using one of the following get methods from the Paths the helper Path p1 Path p2 Path p3 The Paths.get method is shorthand for the following Path p4 The following example creates assuming your home directory is or C:\joe\logs\foo.log if you are on Path p5 Retrieving Information about Path You can think of the Path as storing these name elements as The highest element in the directory structure would be located at index The lowest element in the directory structure would be located at index where is the number of name elements in the Path Methods are available for retrieving individual elements or subsequence of the Path using these The examples in this lesson use the following directory Sample Directory Structure The following code snippet defines Path instance and then invokes several methods to obtain information about the None of these methods requires that the file corresponding to the Path Microsoft Windows syntax Path path Solaris syntax Path path Here is the output for both Windows and the Solaris Method Invoked Returns in the Solaris OS Returns in Microsoft Windows Comment toString C:\home\joe\foo Returns the string representation of the Path If the path was created using or Paths.get latter is convenience method for getPath the method performs minor syntactic For in UNIX operating it will correct the input string to getFileName foo foo Returns the file name or the last element of the sequence of name home home Returns the path element corresponding to the specified The element is the path element closest to the getNameCount Returns the number of elements in the home/joe home\joe Returns the subsequence of the Path including root as specified by the beginning and ending getParent Returns the path of the parent getRoot Returns the root of the The previous example shows the output for an absolute In the following relative path is Solaris syntax Path path or Microsoft Windows syntax Path path Here is the output for Windows and the Solaris Method Invoked Returns in the Solaris OS Returns in Microsoft Windows toString sally/bar sally\bar getFileName bar bar sally sally getNameCount sally sally getParent sally sally getRoot null null Removing Redundancies From Path Many file systems use notation to denote the current directory and to denote the parent You might have situation where Path contains redundant directory Perhaps server is configured to save its log files in the and you want to delete the trailing notation from the The following examples both include The normalize method removes any redundant which includes any or directory Both of the preceding examples normalize to It is important to note that normalize doesn't check at the file system when it cleans up It is purely syntactic In the second if sally were symbolic removing might result in Path that no longer locates the intended To clean up path while ensuring that the result locates the correct you can use the toRealPath This method is described in the next Converting Path Converting Path You can use three methods to convert the Path If you need to convert the path to string that can be opened from you can use toUri For Path p1 Result is file:///home/logfile The toAbsolutePath method converts path to an absolute If the passed-in path is already it returns the same Path The toAbsolutePath method can be very helpful when processing user-entered file For public class FileTest public static void if FileTest Converts the input string to Path Path inputPath Converts the input Path to an absolute this means prepending the current working If this example were called like java FileTest foo the getRoot and getParent methods would return null on the original Invoking getRoot and getParent on the instance returns expected Path fullPath The toAbsolutePath method converts the user input and returns Path that returns useful values when The file does not need to exist for this method to The toRealPath method returns the real path of an existing This method performs several operations in If true is passed to this method and the file system supports symbolic this method resolves any symbolic links in the If the Path is it returns an absolute If the Path contains any redundant it returns path with those elements This method throws an exception if the file does not exist or cannot be You can catch the exception when you want to handle any of these For try Path fp catch no file or Logic for case when file doesn't catch Logic for other sort of file Joining Two Paths You can combine paths by using the resolve You pass in partial path which is path that does not include root and that partial path is appended to the original For consider the following code Solaris Path p1 Result is or Microsoft Windows Path p1 Result is C:\home\joe\foo\bar Passing an absolute path to the resolve method returns the passed-in Result is Creating Path Between Two Paths common requirement when you are writing file I/O code is the capability to construct path from one location in the file system to another You can meet this using the relativize This method constructs path originating from the original path and ending at the location specified by the passed-in The new path is relative to the original For consider two relative paths defined as joe and sally Path p1 Path p2 In the absence of any other it is assumed that joe and sally are meaning nodes that reside at the same level in the tree To navigate from joe to sally you would expect to first navigate one level up to the parent node and then down to sally Result is Path p1_to_p2 Result is Path p2_to_p1 Consider slightly more complicated Path p1 Path p3 Result is sally/bar Path p1_to_p3 Result is Path p3_to_p1 In this the two paths share the same home To navigate from home to bar you first navigate one level down to sally and then one more level down to bar Navigating from bar to home requires moving up two relative path cannot be constructed if only one of the paths includes root If both paths include root the capability to construct relative path is system The recursive Copy example uses the relativize and resolve Comparing Two Paths The Path class supports equals enabling you to test two paths for The startsWith and endsWith methods enable you to test whether path begins or ends with particular These methods are easy to For Path path Path otherPath Path beginning Path ending if equality logic here else if path begins with else if path ends with The Path class implements the Iterable The iterator method returns an object that enables you to iterate over the name elements in the The first element returned is that closest to the root in the directory The following code snippet iterates over printing each name Path path for The Path class also implements the Comparable You can compare Path objects by using compareTo which is useful for You can also put Path objects into Collection See the Collections trail for more information about this powerful When you want to verify that two Path objects locate the same you can use the isSameFile as described in Checking Whether Two Paths Locate the Same File Previous Trail Next About

Edit this page  Share Theme Sign in Naming and Namespaces minutes to read All file systems supported by Windows use the concept of files and directories to access data stored on disk or Windows developers working with the Windows APIs for file and device I/O should understand the various and limitations of names for files and Data can be accessed from and network shares using file I/O Files and along with are part of the concept of which is string representation of where to get the data regardless if it's from disk or device or network connection for specific Some file such as support linked files and which also follow file naming conventions and rules just as regular file or directory For additional see Hard Links and Junctions and Reparse Points and File Operations For additional see the following File and Directory Names Naming Conventions Short Long Names Paths Fully Qualified Relative Paths Maximum Path Length Limitation Namespaces Win32 File Namespaces Win32 Device Namespaces NT Namespaces Related topics File and Directory Names All file systems follow the same general naming conventions for an individual base file name and an optional separated by each file such as and can have specific and differing rules about the formation of the individual components in the path to directory or Note that directory is simply file with special attribute designating it as but otherwise must follow all the same naming rules as regular Because the term directory simply refers to special type of file as far as the file system is some reference material will use the general term file to encompass both concepts of directories and data files as Because of unless otherwise any naming or usage rules or examples for file should also apply to The term path refers to one or more and possibly volume For more see the Paths Character count limitations can also be different and can vary depending on the file system and path name prefix format This is further complicated by support for backward compatibility For the older MS-DOS FAT file system supports maximum of characters for the base file name and characters for the for total of characters including the dot This is commonly known as an file name The Windows FAT and NTFS file systems are not limited to file because they have long file name support but they still support the version of long file Naming Conventions The following fundamental rules enable applications to create and process valid names for files and regardless of the file Use period to separate the base file name from the extension in the name of directory or Use backslash to separate the components of path The backslash divides the file name from the path to and one directory name from another directory name in You cannot use backslash in the name for the actual file or directory because it is reserved character that separates the names into Use backslash as required as part of volume names for the in or the in for Universal Naming Convention For more information about UNC see the Maximum Path Length Limitation Do not assume case For consider the names and oscar to be the even though some file systems as POSIX-compliant file may consider them as Note that NTFS supports POSIX semantics for case sensitivity but this is not the default For more see CreateFile Volume designators are similarly For and refer to the same Use any character in the current code page for including Unicode characters and characters in the extended character set except for the The following reserved bar or Integer value sometimes referred to as the ASCII NUL Characters whose integer representations are in the range from through except for alternate data streams where these characters are For more information about file see File Streams Any other character that the target file system does not Use period as directory component in path to represent the current for example For more see Paths Use two consecutive periods as directory component in path to represent the parent of the current for example For more see Paths Do not use the following reserved names for the name of and Also avoid these names followed immediately by an for NUL.txt is not For more see Namespaces Do not end file or directory name with space or Although the underlying file system may support such the Windows shell and user interface does it is acceptable to specify period as the first character of For Short Long Names long file name is considered to be any file name that exceeds the short MS-DOS called style naming When you create long file Windows may also create short form of the called the alias or short and store it on disk This aliasing can be disabled for performance reasons either systemwide or for specified depending on the particular file Windows Server Windows Windows Server and Windows aliasing cannot be disabled for specified volumes until Windows and Windows Server On many file file name will contain tilde within each component of the name that is too long to comply with naming Note Not all file systems follow the tilde substitution and systems can be configured to disable alias generation even if they normally support do not make the assumption that the alias already exists To request file long file or the full path of file from the consider the following To get the form of long file use the GetShortPathName To get the long file name version of short use the GetLongPathName To get the full path to use the GetFullPathName On newer file such as and Windows stores the long file names on disk in which means that the original long file name is always This is true even if long file name contains extended regardless of the code page that is active during disk read or write Files using long file names can be copied between NTFS file system partitions and Windows FAT file system partitions without losing any file name This may not be true for the older MS-DOS FAT and some types of CDFS file depending on the actual file In this the short file name is substituted if Paths The path to specified file consists of one or more components separated by special character with each component usually being directory name or file but with some notable exceptions discussed It is often critical to the system's interpretation of path what the or prefix of the path looks This prefix determines the namespace the path is and additionally what special characters are used in which position within the including the last If component of path is file it must be the last Each component of path will also be constrained by the maximum length specified for particular file In these rules fall into two short and long Note that directory names are stored by the file system as special type of but naming rules for files also apply to directory To path is simply the string representation of the hierarchy between all of the directories that exist for particular file or directory Fully Qualified Relative Paths For Windows API functions that manipulate file names can often be relative to the current while some APIs require fully qualified file name is relative to the current directory if it does not begin with one of the UNC name of any which always start with two backslash characters For more see the next disk designator with for example or single for or This is also referred to as an absolute path If file name begins with only disk designator but not the backslash after the it is interpreted as relative path to the current directory on the drive with the specified Note that the current directory may or may not be the root directory depending on what it was set to during the most recent operation on that Examples of this format are as refers to file named in the current directory on drive refers to file in subdirectory to the current directory on drive path is also said to be relative if it contains that two periods together in one component of the This special specifier is used to denote the directory above the current otherwise known as the Examples of this format are as specifies file named tmp.txt located in the parent of the current specifies file that is two directories above the current specifies file named tmp.txt located in directory named tempdir that is peer directory to the current Relative paths can combine both example for example This is useful although the system keeps track of the current drive along with the current directory of that it also keeps track of the current directories in each of the different drive letters your system has more than regardless of which drive designator is set as the current Maximum Path Length Limitation In the Windows API some exceptions discussed in the following the maximum length for path is MAX_PATH which is defined as local path is structured in the following drive name components separated by and terminating null For the maximum path on drive is some path string where represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system characters are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of valid path Note File I/O functions in the Windows API convert to as part of converting the name to an NT-style except when using the prefix as detailed in the following The Windows API has many functions that also have Unicode versions to permit an extended-length path for maximum total path length of This type of path is composed of components separated by each up to the value returned in the lpMaximumComponentLength parameter of the GetVolumeInformation function value is commonly To specify an extended-length use the For very long path Note The maximum path of characters is because the prefix may be expanded to longer string by the system at run and this expansion applies to the total The prefix can also be used with paths constructed according to the universal naming convention To specify such path using use the For where is the name of the computer and is the name of the shared These prefixes are not used as part of the path They indicate that the path should be passed to the system with minimal which means that you cannot use forward slashes to represent path or period to represent the current or double dots to represent the parent Because you cannot use the prefix with relative relative paths are always limited to total of MAX_PATH There is no need to perform any Unicode normalization on path and file name strings for use by the Windows file I/O API functions because the file system treats path and file names as an opaque sequence of WCHAR Any normalization that your application requires should be performed with this in external of any calls to related Windows file I/O API When using an API to create the specified path cannot be so long that you cannot append an file name the directory name cannot exceed MAX_PATH minus The shell and the file system have different It is possible to create path with the Windows API that the shell user interface is not able to interpret Tip Starting in Windows version MAX_PATH limitations have been removed from common Win32 file and directory you must opt-in to the new registry key allows you to enable or disable the new long path To enable long path behavior set the registry key at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem LongPathsEnabled The key's value will be cached by the system after the first call to an affected Win32 file or directory function The registry key will not be reloaded during the lifetime of the In order for all apps on the system to recognize the value of the reboot might be required because some processes may have started before the key was The registry key can also be controlled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration Administrative Templates System Filesystem Enable NTFS long paths You can also enable the new long path behavior per app via the true These are the directory management functions that no longer have MAX_PATH restrictions if you opt-in to long path CreateDirectoryExW GetCurrentDirectoryW RemoveDirectoryW These are the file management functions that no longer have MAX_PATH restrictions if you opt-in to long path Namespaces There are two main categories of namespace conventions used in the Windows commonly referred to as NT namespaces and the Win32 namespaces The NT namespace was designed to be the lowest level namespace on which other subsystems and namespaces could including the Win32 subsystem by the Win32 POSIX is another example of subsystem in Windows that is built on top of the NT Early versions of Windows also defined several or names for certain special devices such as communications and ports and the default display console as part of what is now called the NT device and are still supported in current versions of Windows for backward Win32 File Namespaces The Win32 namespace prefixing and conventions are summarized in this section and the following with descriptions of how they are Note that these examples are intended for use with the Windows API functions and do not all necessarily work with Windows shell applications such as Windows For this reason there is wider range of possible paths than is usually available from Windows shell and Windows applications that take advantage of this can be developed using these namespace For file the prefix to path string tells the Windows APIs to disable all string parsing and to send the string that follows it straight to the file For if the file system supports large paths and file you can exceed the MAX_PATH limits that are otherwise enforced by the Windows For more information about the normal maximum path see the previous section Maximum Path Length Limitation Because it turns off automatic expansion of the path the prefix also allows the use of and in the path which can be useful if you are attempting to perform operations on file with these otherwise reserved relative path specifiers as part of the fully qualified Many but not all file I/O APIs support you should look at the reference topic for each API to be Win32 Device Namespaces The prefix will access the Win32 device namespace instead of the Win32 file This is how access to physical disks and volumes is accomplished without going through the file if the API supports this type of You can access many devices other than disks this way the CreateFile and DefineDosDevice for For if you want to open the system's serial communications port you can use in the call to the CreateFile This works because COM1?COM9 are part of the reserved names in the NT although using the prefix will also work with these device By if you have port serial expansion board installed and want to open you cannot open it using because there is no predefined NT namespace for You will need to open it using because goes directly to the device namespace without attempting to locate predefined Another example of using the Win32 device namespace is using the CreateFile function with is valid integer or This allows you to access those devices bypassing the file This works because these device names are created by the system as these devices are and some drivers will also create other aliases in the For the device driver that implements the name has its own namespace that also happens to be the file APIs that go through the CreateFile function generally work with the prefix because CreateFile is the function used to open both files and depending on the parameters you If you're working with Windows API you should use the prefix to access devices only and not Most APIs won't support only those that are designed to work with the device namespace will recognize Always check the reference topic for each API to be NT Namespaces There are also APIs that allow the use of the NT namespace but the Windows Object Manager makes that unnecessary in most To it is useful to browse the Windows namespaces in the system object browser using the Windows Sysinternals WinObj When you run this what you see is the NT namespace beginning at the or The subfolder called is where the Win32 namespace Named device objects reside in the NT namespace within the Here you may also find Serial0 and the device objects representing the first two COM ports if present on your device object representing volume would be something like although the numeric suffix may The name under subdirectory is an example of the device object representing and so To make these device objects accessible by Windows the device drivers create symbolic link in the Win32 to their respective device For COM0 and COM1 under the subdirectory are simply symlinks to Serial0 and is symlink to is symlink to and so Without specified device will not be available to any Windows application using Win32 namespace conventions as described handle could be opened to that device using any APIs that support the NT namespace absolute path of the format With the addition of multi-user support via Terminal Services and virtual it has further become necessary to virtualize the system-wide root device within the Win32 This was accomplished by adding the symlink named to the Win32 which you can see in the subdirectory of the WinObj browser tool previously and can access via the path This prefix ensures that the path following it looks in the true root

that comprise the internal of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the If class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by super.clone need to be The method clone for class Object performs specific cloning if the class of this object does not implement the interface Cloneable then CloneNotSupportedException is Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface Cloneable and that the return type of the clone method of an array type is where is any reference or primitive this method creates new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this as if by the contents of the fields are not themselves this method performs of this not The class Object does not itself implement the interface Cloneable so calling the clone method on an object whose class is

determines that there are no more references to the subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other The general contract of finalize is that it is invoked if and when the virtual machine has determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet except as result of an action taken by the finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be The finalize method may take any including making this object available again to other the usual purpose of finalize is to perform cleanup actions before the object is irrevocably For the finalize method for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is permanently The finalize method of class Object performs no special it simply returns Subclasses of Object may override this The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will invoke the finalize method for any given It is that the thread that invokes finalize will not be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize the exception is ignored and finalization of that object After the finalize method has been invoked for an no further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be at which point the object may be The finalize method is never invoked more than once by Java virtual machine for any given Any exception thrown by the finalize method causes the finalization of this object to

practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later Path Operations The Path class includes various methods that can be used to obtain information about the access elements of the convert the path to other or extract portions of There are also methods for matching the path string and methods for removing redundancies in This lesson addresses these Path sometimes called syntactic because they operate on the path itself and don't access the file This section covers the Creating Path Retrieving Information About Path Removing Redundancies from Path Converting Path Joining Two Paths Creating Path Between Two Paths Comparing Two Paths Creating Path Path instance contains the information used to specify the location of file or At the time it is Path is provided with series of one or more root element or file name might be but neither are Path might consist of just single directory or file You can easily create Path object by using one of the following get methods from the Paths the helper Path p1 Path p2 Path p3 The Paths.get method is shorthand for the following Path p4 The following example creates assuming your home directory is or C:\joe\logs\foo.log if you are on Path p5 Retrieving Information about Path You can think of the Path as storing these name elements as The highest element in the directory structure would be located at index The lowest element in the directory structure would be located at index where is the number of name elements in the Path Methods are available for retrieving individual elements or subsequence of the Path using these The examples in this lesson use the following directory Sample Directory Structure The following code snippet defines Path instance and then invokes several methods to obtain information about the None of these methods requires that the file corresponding to the Path Microsoft Windows syntax Path path Solaris syntax Path path Here is the output for both Windows and the Solaris Method Invoked Returns in the Solaris OS Returns in Microsoft Windows Comment toString C:\home\joe\foo Returns the string representation of the Path If the path was created using or Paths.get latter is convenience method for getPath the method performs minor syntactic For in UNIX operating it will correct the input string to getFileName foo foo Returns the file name or the last element of the sequence of name home home Returns the path element corresponding to the specified The element is the path element closest to the getNameCount Returns the number of elements in the home/joe home\joe Returns the subsequence of the Path including root as specified by the beginning and ending getParent Returns the path of the parent getRoot Returns the root of the The previous example shows the output for an absolute In the following relative path is Solaris syntax Path path or Microsoft Windows syntax Path path Here is the output for Windows and the Solaris Method Invoked Returns in the Solaris OS Returns in Microsoft Windows toString sally/bar sally\bar getFileName bar bar sally sally getNameCount sally sally getParent sally sally getRoot null null Removing Redundancies From Path Many file systems use notation to denote the current directory and to denote the parent You might have situation where Path contains redundant directory Perhaps server is configured to save its log files in the and you want to delete the trailing notation from the The following examples both include The normalize method removes any redundant which includes any or directory Both of the preceding examples normalize to It is important to note that normalize doesn't check at the file system when it cleans up It is purely syntactic In the second if sally were symbolic removing might result in Path that no longer locates the intended To clean up path while ensuring that the result locates the correct you can use the toRealPath This method is described in the next Converting Path Converting Path You can use three methods to convert the Path If you need to convert the path to string that can be opened from you can use toUri For Path p1 Result is file:///home/logfile The toAbsolutePath method converts path to an absolute If the passed-in path is already it returns the same Path The toAbsolutePath method can be very helpful when processing user-entered file For public class FileTest public static void if FileTest Converts the input string to Path Path inputPath Converts the input Path to an absolute this means prepending the current working If this example were called like java FileTest foo the getRoot and getParent methods would return null on the original Invoking getRoot and getParent on the instance returns expected Path fullPath The toAbsolutePath method converts the user input and returns Path that returns useful values when The file does not need to exist for this method to The toRealPath method returns the real path of an existing This method performs several operations in If true is passed to this method and the file system supports symbolic this method resolves any symbolic links in the If the Path is it returns an absolute If the Path contains any redundant it returns path with those elements This method throws an exception if the file does not exist or cannot be You can catch the exception when you want to handle any of these For try Path fp catch no file or Logic for case when file doesn't catch Logic for other sort of file Joining Two Paths You can combine paths by using the resolve You pass in partial path which is path that does not include root and that partial path is appended to the original For consider the following code Solaris Path p1 Result is or Microsoft Windows Path p1 Result is C:\home\joe\foo\bar Passing an absolute path to the resolve method returns the passed-in Result is Creating Path Between Two Paths common requirement when you are writing file I/O code is the capability to construct path from one location in the file system to another You can meet this using the relativize This method constructs path originating from the original path and ending at the location specified by the passed-in The new path is relative to the original For consider two relative paths defined as joe and sally Path p1 Path p2 In the absence of any other it is assumed that joe and sally are meaning nodes that reside at the same level in the tree To navigate from joe to sally you would expect to first navigate one level up to the parent node and then down to sally Result is Path p1_to_p2 Result is Path p2_to_p1 Consider slightly more complicated Path p1 Path p3 Result is sally/bar Path p1_to_p3 Result is Path p3_to_p1 In this the two paths share the same home To navigate from home to bar you first navigate one level down to sally and then one more level down to bar Navigating from bar to home requires moving up two relative path cannot be constructed if only one of the paths includes root If both paths include root the capability to construct relative path is system The recursive Copy example uses the relativize and resolve Comparing Two Paths The Path class supports equals enabling you to test two paths for The startsWith and endsWith methods enable you to test whether path begins or ends with particular These methods are easy to For Path path Path otherPath Path beginning Path ending if equality logic here else if path begins with else if path ends with The Path class implements the Iterable The iterator method returns an object that enables you to iterate over the name elements in the The first element returned is that closest to the root in the directory The following code snippet iterates over printing each name Path path for The Path class also implements the Comparable You can compare Path objects by using compareTo which is useful for You can also put Path objects into Collection See the Collections trail for more information about this powerful When you want to verify that two Path objects locate the same you can use the isSameFile as described in Checking Whether Two Paths Locate the Same File Previous Trail Next About
