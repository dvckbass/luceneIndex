VALUES and one of the paths in is note that the paranthesis around the select statement are required meaning zapl Jul at show more comments Both the answers see work fine in Informix and are basically standard That the INSERT INTO SELECT FROM works fine with Informix would all the upon or more years this is the sort of thing that MySQL did not always it now has decent support for this sort of standard SQL syntax it would work OK on this The column list is optional but indicates the target columns in so the first column of the result of the SELECT will go into the first listed In the absence of the column the first column of the result of the SELECT goes into the first column of the target What can be different between systems is the notation used to identify tables in different databases the standard has nothing to say about inter-database alone With you can use the following notation to identify That you may specify optionally identifying the server that hosts that database if it is not in the current followed by an optional and finally the actual table The SQL standard uses the term schema for what Informix calls the in any of the following notations could identify table dbase table dbase owner.table dbase@server table dbase@server owner.table The owner in general does not need to be if you do use you need to get the owner name spelled correctly it becomes That someone.table SOMEONE.table all identify the same With there's mild complication with MODE ANSI where owner names are generally converted to upper-case is the That in MODE ANSI database commonly you could CREATE TABLE someone.table and the owner name in the system catalog would be rather than If you enclose the owner name in double it acts like delimited With standard delimited identifiers can be used many With you can use them only around owner names in other Informix treats both single-quoted and double-quoted strings as rather than separating single-quoted strings as strings and double-quoted strings as delimited just for there is an environment that can be set to any but is safest to indicate that double quotes always surround delimited identifiers and single quotes always surround Note that MS SQL Server manages to use enclosed in square It looks weird to and is certainly not part of the SQL share improve this answer answered Sep at Jonathan Leffler add comment Most of
